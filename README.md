# CarDealership

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 9.0.6. This is simple project for demo. So I have try to touch most of features in some extend like ui design using bootstrap, ng-routing concept, pipe, service, web api call.

## Development server
Run 'ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --port 4201'. proxy.conf.json used to define web api proxy and --port 4201 to open in another port if port 4200 is in already use

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Due to short of time I could write test case.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
